# waPC Go

This is the Golang implementation of the [waPC](https://github.com/wapc) standard for WebAssembly host runtimes. It allows any WebAssembly module to be loaded as a guest and receive requests for invocation as well as to make its own function requests of the host. To begin with this implementation is only intended to work with the [Perlin Life WebAssembly VM](https://github.com/perlin-network/life)
